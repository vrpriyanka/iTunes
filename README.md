# iTunes

This is a simple project where user can enter any artist name to retrieve all iTunes based on their artist name
For the result I fetched iTunes based on artist name from api using retrofit and display them on recycler view

Used Dagger which frees you from writing tedious and error-prone boilerplate code by: Generating the AppContainer code (application graph) 
that you manually implemented in the manual DI section. This improves your app's performance by releasing objects in memory when they're no longer needed.

Used Glide to load image from the url

Used Navigation graphs to navigate between fragments

Created test cases using Mockito and dagger injections to test the view model, api and api services.
